# MECHANICAL TRAINING TASK

**Important Notes:**
- DO NOT make any changes to the part or drawing files provided to you. They are for your reference and to ensure the assembly files work.
- DO NOT change the names of the part files provided to you.
- “Expectations” are what we are looking for when reviewing your training tasks. Attempt to fulfill all the bullet points to the best of your ability. 

# PART 1: ASSEMBLIES
Download the following parts from the folder, “PART 1: ASSEMBLIES”. Your first task is to create an assembly that combines the parts into a sliding mechanism, as shown in the video below:

**Expectations:**
- Creating a **fully-functional** assembly file
- Ability to use Mate tool (standard and advanced mate)
- Rotation and Move Component tool

# PART 2: MODELING
In the folder named, “PART 2: MODELING” you will be presented with a door lock assembly file (+ separate part files) and an SG90 servo motor (+ accessories). Your task is to create a mount for the servo motor and an arm that slides the latch back and forth. See an example below:

Example door lock mechanism with servo:

**Expectations:**
- Creating a fully-functional assembly file (including the parts you designed)
- Use of tools including: extrude, pattern tool, fillet, chamfer, slot, and hole cut (try to use as many as these!)
- Proper dimensioning in millimeters
- Proper use of resources provided to you
- Functionality of the design
- Attention to detail
- Creativity

# BONUS
For the door locking mechanism you completed in Part 2, go on McMaster Carr’s website (https://www.mcmaster.com/) and browse for the correct **Philips flat head screws** that satisfies the following requirements:

- M4
- Length: 6mm
- Material: Stainless Steel
- Head diameter: 7.5mm
- Head height: 2.2mm
- Thread pitch: 0.7mm

Once you have found the piece that satisfies all the requirements above, download the CAD file compatible and insert it into your assembly. **Note:** you do not need to mate the screws into the door lock. We want to see it in your assembly. If you are unable to download the CAD file and import it in, please download the PDF drawing and place it into your submission folder. 

# SUBMISSION
Under one zip folder, have your subfolders labeled as Part 1, 2, and Bonus. 

**In your Part 1 folder, please include:**
- All parts used in the assembly
- Final assembly file with your changes

**In your Part 2 folder, please include:**
- All parts used in the assembly
- All of your designed part files
- Final assembly file

**In your Bonus folder, please include:**
- CAD file of the head screw

If you used an online platform to complete the training tasks (ex. Onshape), please provide the **share link** to your folders in a PDF.
