# ELECTRICAL TRAINING TASK

# Task Description
Create a PCB to connect all the items listed in the [Components] section. You will need to read their datasheets and connect the devices properly. Some of the devices may require extra passive components.
The PCB should be 100mm x 40mm with 5mm radius rounded corners.

Also add a power input. You may use a connector of your choice.

Below is a link to wiring the 16x2 LCD to an ESP32 for your reference.
